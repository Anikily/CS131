## What is CV

### 1. Definition

- Computer vision is *building algorithms that can understand the content of images and use it for other applications*.

- Computer vision is hard because there is a huge gap between pixels and
  meaning.

- Definition,history, interdisciplinary

- Hard problem:poetry harder than chess,Vison harder than 3D modeling,semantic

### 2. How human see

1.Get images and transmit it to brain for process

2.Processing these information in ***different regions*** and **multisteps**

- Changing small irrelevant parts of an image such as water reflection or background can go unnoticed because the ***human brain focuses on the important parts of an image***

- Previous knowledge is one of the most difficult tool to incorporate into computer vision. Humans use context to know where to focus on an image, to know what to expect at certain positions.

- Simulationg nature may not help to built a intelligent system but it is luminous

### 3. Extracting information from images

- Information gained from cv method:***measurment and semantic***

  #### Measurement

  - Stereo images through triangulation to detect depth
  - 3D reconstruction by numerous camera
  - Grasping

  #### Sematic information

  - label objects in an image, label the whole scene, recognize people, recognize actions, gestures,faces.
  - Medical images
