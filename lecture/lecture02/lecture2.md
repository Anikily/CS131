# Color and linear Algebra

###1.Physic of Color

- Color is the result of interaction between physical light in the environment and our visual system.   Psychological

- Light is made up of waves of different wavelengths.
- Any source of light can be completely described physically by its spectrum 
- Reflected color is the result of interaction of the light source spectrum with the surface reflectance.

### 2.Human Encoding of Color

-  Rods detecting objects in low-light conditions and they do not encode any color information
- Cones are useful for distinguishing between objects in high light conditions

-  **the proposition that three numbers are sufficient for encoding color** 

### 3.Color Spaces

#### definition

The fundation of CV is digital form of image,and the fundamental part of digital image is color space.Using mathematical way to describe image by RGB or other color model.

#### Linear Color Space

- RGB
- CIE XYZ Color Space

#### Nonlinear Color Space:HSV

- HSV

### 4.White Balancing

- performed automatically by digital cameras

#### Reasons:

- The sensors in cameras or film are different from those in our eyes
- Different display media render images differently, which must be accounted for
- The viewing conditions when the image was taken are usually different from the image
  viewing conditions

### 5.Vectors and Metrix

- Vectors:vectors can represent an offset in 2 or3 dimensional space.
- Vectors:vectors can represent data  In this use case, the vectors do not have a
  geometric interpretation but calculations like "distance" can still have value.
